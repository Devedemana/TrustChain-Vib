## 🏆 For Hackathon Judges & Demo Users

- **No backend required for demo:** The app auto-switches to mock data in production (e.g., Vercel), so you can explore all features without deploying the Internet Computer backend.
- **How to run the demo:**
  1. Visit the deployed Vercel link or run locally with `npm run dev`.
  2. All credential features (issue, verify, view) work with realistic mock data.
- **AI-powered tests:**
  - See `src/utils/mockData.test.ts` for example tests generated and maintained with AI assistance (run with `npx vitest run`).
- **Code is AI-optimized:**
  - GitHub Copilot and Claude were used for code, tests, and documentation.
- **Want to see the real blockchain backend?**
  - Deploy with DFX and Motoko (see instructions above) and set `REACT_APP_MOCK_DATA=false` in your environment.
