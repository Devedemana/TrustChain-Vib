### Backend API

The Motoko backend provides the following functions:

```motoko
// Issue a new credential
issueCredential(owner: Principal, metadata: Text) : async Result.Result<Text, Text>

// Verify a credential by ID
verifyCredential(id: Text) : async ?Text

// Get all credentials (admin)
getAllCredentials() : async [Credential]

// Get credential count
getCredentialCount() : async Nat

// System information
getSystemInfo() : async Text
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Get all credentials
dfx canister call trustchain_backend getAllCredentials

# Issue a test credential
dfx canister call trustchain_backend issueCredential '(principal "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaah-qacaa-cai", "{\"degree\": \"Test Degree\"}")'

# Verify a credential
dfx canister call trustchain_backend verifyCredential '"credential_id_here"'

# Get system info
dfx canister call trustchain_backend getSystemInfo
```

## 📸 Screenshots

## 🏆 For Hackathon Judges & Demo Users

- **No backend required for demo:** The app auto-switches to mock data in production (e.g., Vercel), so you can explore all features without deploying the Internet Computer backend.
- **How to run the demo:**
  1. Visit the deployed Vercel link or run locally with `npm run dev`.
  2. All credential features (issue, verify, view) work with realistic mock data.
- **AI-powered tests:**
  - See `src/utils/mockData.test.ts` for example tests generated and maintained with AI assistance (run with `npx vitest run`).
- **Code is AI-optimized:**
  - GitHub Copilot and Claude were used for code, tests, and documentation.
- **Want to see the real blockchain backend?**
  - Deploy with DFX and Motoko (see instructions above) and set `REACT_APP_MOCK_DATA=false` in your environment.
