# TrustChain Development Instructions

## Project Context
This is a decentralized academic credential verification system built on Internet Computer using Motoko for smart contracts and React for the frontend.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all React components
- Follow Material-UI design patterns for consistent UI
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Implement proper error handling for blockchain interactions
- Add TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

## Key Technologies
- Internet Computer (IC) blockchain
- Motoko programming language for smart contracts
- React with TypeScript for frontend
- Material-UI for component library
- DFX SDK for deployment

## Development Patterns
- Use async/await for blockchain calls
- Mock data for development when IC backend is not available
- Implement proper loading states for user interactions
- Follow responsive design principles
- Use semantic HTML and accessible components

## Security Considerations
- Validate all user inputs before blockchain calls
- Implement proper authentication for institutions
- Use cryptographic hashing for credential verification
- Follow IC security best practices
