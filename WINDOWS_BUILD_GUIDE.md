# 🔧 Windows Build & IC Canister ID Guide

## ✅ Windows Build Fixed!

The issue was that Windows doesn't recognize Unix-style environment variable syntax. We've fixed this with multiple approaches:

### Method 1: Cross-env (Recommended)
```bash
npm run build:production
```
This now uses `cross-env` to set environment variables on all platforms.

### Method 2: Windows Batch Script
```bash
npm run build:windows
# OR directly run:
build-production.bat
```

### Method 3: Manual Environment
Set in your `.env.local` file (which you already have):
```env
REACT_APP_USE_PRODUCTION=true
```
Then run: `npm run build`

## 🔗 IC Canister ID Validation

### Your Current Canister ID
```
4AA45-9A7CD-CC4C3
```

### ⚠️ Important Note
This doesn't look like a standard IC canister ID format. IC canister IDs typically look like:
- `rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaah-qcaiq-cai`
- `rrkah-fqaaa-aaaah-qcuwa-cai`
- `renrk-eyaaa-aaaah-qcoma-cai`

### How to Get Your Correct Canister ID

#### Option 1: From DFX CLI
If you deployed with dfx:
```bash
dfx canister id trustchain_backend
```

#### Option 2: From IC Dashboard
1. Go to https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/
2. Search for your canister
3. Copy the correct canister ID

#### Option 3: From Deployment Output
Check your deployment logs for lines like:
```
Installing code for canister trustchain_backend, with canister ID rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaah-qcaiq-cai
```

### Update Your Canister ID
Once you have the correct ID, update `.env.local`:
```env
REACT_APP_CANISTER_ID=your-correct-canister-id-here
```

## 🧪 Test Your Configuration

### 1. Check Build Output
After running the build, look for these console messages:
```
✅ Production configuration validated successfully!
🚀 Connecting to IC mainnet with canister: your-canister-id
```

### 2. Test in Browser
1. Run the build: `npm run build:production`
2. Serve locally: `npx serve dist`
3. Check browser console for production mode indicators
4. Look for the "🚀 PRODUCTION" badge in the app header

### 3. Verify IC Connection
The app should show:
- ✅ "IC Mainnet" indicator in header
- ✅ Real-time connection status
- ✅ Production mode badge

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Invalid Canister ID" 
**Solution**: Verify your canister ID format and update `.env.local`

### Issue: Still seeing mock data
**Solution**: Ensure `.env.local` has:
```env
REACT_APP_USE_PRODUCTION=true
REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_DATA=false
```

### Issue: Build fails on Windows
**Solutions**:
1. Use `npm run build:production` (with cross-env)
2. Use `npm run build:windows` (batch script)
3. Set environment variables in `.env.local` then run `npm run build`
